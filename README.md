## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd product_app
```

4. Install dependencies:

```
flutter pub get
```

5. Run the app:

```
flutter run
```

## Project Architecture

The project follows a standard Flutter application structure:

- `lib/`: Contains the main Dart code for the application.

  - `main.dart`: Entry point of the application.
  - `views/`: Contains the UI screens.
  - `models/`: Contains data models.
  - `providers/`: Contains state management logic using Riverpod.
  - `services/`: Contains API services and other business logic.

- `assets/`: Contains static assets like images and JSON files.

## State Management

This project uses Riverpod for state management. Riverpod was chosen for its simplicity, testability, and efficient dependency injection capabilities.

Key benefits of using Riverpod in this project:

1. Separation of concerns: Business logic is kept separate from UI components.
2. Easy testing: Providers can be easily mocked and tested.
3. Efficient rebuilds: Only widgets that depend on changed state are rebuilt.

The main state management logic can be found in the `providers/` directory.

## Assumptions

1. API Endpoint: The application assumes a specific API endpoint structure for fetching product data. Any changes to the API might require updates to the `services/` files.

2. Internet Connectivity: The app assumes that the device has an active internet connection to fetch product data.

3. JSON Structure: The app expects a specific JSON structure for product data. Changes in the API response format may require updates to the model classes.

4. Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented, but real-world scenarios might require more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

5. Performance: The app is designed for a reasonable number of products. Large datasets might require pagination or virtual scrolling implementations.

6. Platform Support: While Flutter supports multiple platforms, this app has been primarily tested on Android and iOS. Additional configuration might be needed for web or desktop deployments.

7. Localization: The app currently doesn't support multiple languages. Implementing localization would require additional setup.
